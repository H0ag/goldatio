# 🟡 Goldatio

> 📚 Summary engine based on Wikipedia, built in Python using Tkinter.

Goldatio is one of my very first programming projects, made before the rise of generative AIs like ChatGPT.  
Its purpose? Let the user enter a name (of a person, object, concept...) and get a summarized and translated result via the Wikipedia API.

This is a **historical** project for me — I’m preserving it as a memory of where I started.

## 👤 About the Author

> My name is Maël, I was 14 when I built this project.  
I was learning Python, exploring graphical interfaces, and working with external APIs.  
Goldatio was my very first attempt at building a **personal assistant** — before AI made it easy.

## 🏛️ Why This Project Matters

Goldatio represents my **first real step** into useful programming.  
I wanted a tool that could understand a query, look things up, and summarize it for me.  
Now that's something AIs can do in seconds — but back then, it was just me and Python, figuring it out.

## 🕰️ Status

📦 **Archived project** — preserved as a memory.  
No updates planned, unless for documentation or critical fixes.

## ✨ Thanks!

Thanks to everyone who supported my early steps into programming.  
And if you’re reading this README... maybe you’re building your own Goldatio too.
